          Founded 2018 by Noma Obaseki, nomatalks has come a long way from its
          beginnings in posting inspiring and motivational quotes. When Noma
          first started out, his passion for writing grew which lead to more
          research so that nomatalks can offer you the best contents. We now
          talk about various issues all over the world, and are thrilled that
          we're able to turn our passion into our own blog.
